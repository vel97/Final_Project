Hi everyone. This is a classification problem regarding customers data who tend to get an insurance. We are going to make prediction with classification algorithms to identify the best model for thwe problem statemen by tring different methods of classification.

**Approach:**
   **Data and cleaning:**
           Using Python, we import the data in csv format using pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
           
   **Visualization:**
          Visualizing the data to get useful information and using the information in modelling for optimal results.
          
   **Modeling of data:**
          After EDA, we split and model the data with different classifcation techniques to identify the best fit for the data. SInce our data is imbalance we first balance the data with imblearn packahe and then proceed to modeling.
          
   **Interpretaion:**
          Interpreting the data using cross validaton and confusion matrix and analyse the performance of the model using the results obtained.
         
**Packages Used:**
       Numpy
       Pandas
       Matplotlib
       Plotline
       imblearn
       sklearn
